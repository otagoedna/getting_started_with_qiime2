# Getting Started with Qiime2

This is an introduction to the Qiime2 multiverse. The main Qiime2 webpage has many good tutorials, instructions, and descriptions of the relevant concepts and theory. The pages here are not meant as a replacement for that vast wealth of information, but rather provide an initial starting point, accompanied by in-class instruction. This workshop will follow through some standard workflows, with other examples given and referencing Qiime2 web materials for further information.
